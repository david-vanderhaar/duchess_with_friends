The site will give us a a way to:
  - create a play room
  - join a play room
  - display a grid for the Duke board
  - drag and drop Duke pieces
  - click to draw a Duke piece from your own bag
  - double click to capture a Duke piece (and place it in your graveyard)
  - add a Blitz clock for timed play
